<h1>ANEMIA</h1>
<p>Anemia in homeopathy is viewed as a sign of imbalance in the body rather than just a deficiency. Treatment focuses on the individual’s overall physical and emotional state. Common remedies include Ferrum Phosphoricum for early-stage anemia, Ferrum Metallicum for fatigue and weakness, China for anemia after blood loss, and Calcarea Phosphorica for growing children. Natrum Muriaticum is used when emotional stress is linked to anemia. Remedies are selected based on the person’s unique symptoms, and homeopathy is best used as a supportive treatment alongside medical care in serious cases.</p>

                <h1>MIGRAINE</h1> 
                <p>Migraine is a recurring, often severe headache that may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smells. It can be triggered by stress, hormonal changes, certain foods, or lack of sleep. In homeopathy, treatment focuses on the individual's specific symptoms and triggers. Remedies are chosen based on the nature and location of the pain, as well as associated symptoms like visual disturbances or emotional stress. For example, some migraines may feel like a throbbing or bursting sensation, worsen with sunlight, or be linked to emotional factors.</p>
